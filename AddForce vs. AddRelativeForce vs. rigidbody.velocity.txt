AddForce vs. AddRelativeForce vs. rigidbody.velocity 


First of all the difference is, rigidbody.velocity sets the velocity property of the rigidbody while AddForce affects velocity while taking other factors into account (drag etc.) in a per-fixed-frame fashion (per FixedUpdate). 
A similar real world example would be letting a slingshot go vs pushing a heavy box. 
We don't directly set the velocity of objects in the real world but that's the closest example I can give.

As for constant force, it's mainly for objects that have their own pushing power. 
Like rockets. It wouldn't be very different than doing AddForce in a script every FixedUpdate (without knowing the actual technical difference between the Constant Force component and doing it yourself, result would be the same nevertheless).

Physics methods (like AddForce) should be called under FixedUpdate, because that is when Unity processes physics calls.
You can set the velocity property whereever you want, since the set velocity will be used on the following fixed updates anyways.
