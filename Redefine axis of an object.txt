You can only actually set that up inside the modeling program you are using.
There is a trick to work around it though. The object you want to change the axis on I'll call ObjectX:

	• create an empty GameObject
	• make the empty GameObject the child of ObjectX
	• reset the Transform of the empty GameObject (it should now center ObjectX)
	• unparent the empty GameObject
	• rotate the empty GameObject so that it's axis are the way you'd like them to be on ObjectX
	• make the empty GameObject the parent of ObjectX
